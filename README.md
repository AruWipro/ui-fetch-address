# What is covered in the project ?
- This project is similar to a search application where user can type in his source location and also enter the range. 
- After entering the details he would receive a list of offices within the range specified.
- In case, where no offices within the range specified the applicaiton would throw an error popup screen which says `Sorry no offices are found`.
	-User can then click on view all offices and get all his partner offices
## Features
- User can specify any source country [![Add Country](Input.png "Add Country")](https://github.com/AruWipro/task-tracker-react/blob/2a272fc634ff0b410e79d9e274aa2b19b3869c3d/Input.png "Add Country")
- User should enter only numbers in the range field **[Only 4 Digits]**
- If there are valid results found, you would see distance and a google map with the destination location

- You can click on the map which takes you to a popup
	- 	Popup contains the services offiered by the company 
	- 	It also contains a google map which would open in. a seperate page
	[![Popup](Popup "Popup")](https://github.com/AruWipro/task-tracker-react/blob/1f434bbcee5fafc82392e99c2c498c8a6fd142c7/popup.png "Popup")
- User can also click on the image of the company, which would route him to the website URL
##Approach taken
- Backend was developed using `Express js` and the radial distance was calculated based on the input co-ordinates
- There were two API's exposed, one to display all the partener companies provided and another to fetch all the companies with in the range provided.
- I have created componentes, which are specific to each functionality.
- I have intentionally created some of the components in `Functional` Style and others in `Class` style just to exhibit it.
- I have not used `store` or `redux` as there are few components and there is no dependency of state variables across the components
- When there are no results with respect to the criteria provided, I have populated an error screen 
##Liberties taken
- Have used a dropdown with **all countries** and their corresponding lat,long. This would help in case the partner offices are expanded to further regions
- Max length of range is `4 digits`
- **By default results are populated in the sorting order of distance** **[asceding]**
- Used a library to calculate distance between coordinates

# Where should I test it?
- The applications is hosted on a cloud platform, so that it can be tested easily.

##Hosted URL
- The application can be tested [here](https://fetch-address-ui.onrender.com "here")

#Areas that can be further improved
- Add store to maintain the state variables
- Consume `Google Directions API` and plot a polyline between source and destination
- I haven't defined a proper docker file as I don't have a good experience over there
- Cover more teset cases
